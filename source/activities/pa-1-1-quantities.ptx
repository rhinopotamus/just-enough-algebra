                    You're filling up a rectangular fish tank that is 4 feet long by 2 feet wide by 3 feet high; as time goes on, the water level gets higher.

            <li>
                <p>
                    You're putting a bunch of bricks in a wheelbarrow; the more bricks you add, the heavier the wheelbarrow is.
                </p>

            <!-- <li>
                <p>
                    You're building a gravel path around a community garden; the wider the path is, the more gravel you will need.

            <li>
                <p>
                    You're driving 50 miles on the highway; the faster you drive, the sooner you will arrive at your destination.
